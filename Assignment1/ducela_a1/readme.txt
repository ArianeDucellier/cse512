The question I tried to answer is: Where and when to enjoy sunshine?

As making 6*12=72 pie plots would have resulted in too much information for the person looking at the image, I decided to group the data by season. I defined the seasons as Winter = December + January + February, Spring = March + April + May, Summer = June + July + August, Autumn = September + October + December. Another choice of seasons would have led to a slightly different image, but the general pattern would stay the same as there are no abrupt changes from one month to another.

To make the subplots, I divided the average number of hours of susnshine per day for each season by 24 hours. The remaining hours corresponds thus to either nighttime, either cloudy sky. The image does not allow to make the difference between all possible reasons for the absence of sunshine. The lack of sunshine in Seattle in winter may be due to the short duration of daylight in winter times, or due to rainy weather, or both. Another possibility would have been to find another dataset with sunrise and sunset times around the year for each city, and divide each pie in three parts. However, I decided to focus on where and when to find sunshine, and not on why we do not have sunshine.

To make the pies, I chose a color naturally associated with the Sun (yellow) and a color naturally associated with clouds and night (grey). As yellow is lighter and brighter than grey, it catches more the attention of the person looking at the image, and helps focus on the sunshine. The choice of pies allows to rapidly compare two cities or two seasons, as it is very easy to see which pie slice is the biggest.
